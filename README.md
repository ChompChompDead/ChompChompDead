### chomp the flip flop

hi im chomp. I code and stuff <br>
if you dont wanna read i know luuuaaa and jaavaaa and frontend with also some backend js <br>
i am currently working on **FaxHack** and **Teddyware**, both java projects on forge 1.12.2 :) <br>

#### What I know (and more)

Currently im learning java and making forge modifications. 
Languages I know: HTML, Lua, CSS, Javascript, Java and python <br>
The only language i know is lua and (maybe im not sure) java. I used to do nodejs a few months ago <br>
but i dont really anymore, and the frontend is just me messing around with websites. <br>
I code roblox and minecraft stuff, also some discord bots <br>
Anyways thats pretty much it <br>
